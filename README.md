# DL_DD_MIMO
This project is to use deep neural network for channel estimation in MIMO communication systems
This project contains three files.
There exsits two functions which are used in the main file which is "DL_Channel_Estimation_Main_V2.m".
One function called "DL_Channel_Estimation_Training_V2.m" do the training step and returns trained DNNs.
The other function called "Decision_Directed_Channel_Estimation_V2.m" is to perform the estimation step using the trained DNNs.
